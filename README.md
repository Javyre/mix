# Atomix 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/outrightmental/go-atomix.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/outrightmental/go-atomix)

#### Sequence-based mixer for Music apps, built on go-sdl2.

Read the API documentation at [godoc.org/github.com/outrightmental/go-atomix](https://godoc.org/github.com/outrightmental/go-atomix)

**Atomix** seeks to solve the problem of audio mixing on top of bare SDL, specifically for the purpose of the playback of sequences where audio files and their playback timing is known in advance. It seeks to do this with the absolute minimal logical overhead to SDL, and implement that logic in pure Go, though it is called entirely via C bindings by the SDL audio callback, for the most idiomatic Go approach to solving the **sequence mixing** problem.

Built on **[go-sdl2](https://github.com/veandco/go-sdl2)** - Go bindings for the C++ library "Simple DirectMedia Layer" **[SDL 2.0](https://www.libsdl.org/)**

### Why?

For sequence mixing in music application development.

Following principles of modularity and reusability according to [The Unix Philosophy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) and assuming the usefulness of [go-sdl2](https://github.com/veandco/go-sdl2) there is still a design problem to be solved, that was equally inherent when using the original [C++ SDL 2.0](https://www.libsdl.org/) library.

This design problem is an **audio mixer**. Most available options are geared towards Game development, including the proprietary [SDL_mixer](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/) project for which the go-sdl2 team [has also implemented bindings](https://github.com/veandco/go-sdl2/blob/master/sdl_mixer/sdl_mixer.go). The design pattern particular to Game design is that the timing of the audio is not know in advance- the timing that really matterns is that which is assembled in near-real-time in response to user interaction.

In the field of Music development, often the timing is known in advance, e.g. a ***sequencer**, the composition of music by specifying exactly how, when and which audio files will be played relative to the beginning of playback.

Ergo, **atomix** seeks to solve the problem of audio mixing on top of bare SDL, specifically for the purpose of the playback of sequences where audio files and their playback timing is known in advance. It seeks to do this with the absolute minimal logical overhead to SDL, and implement that logic in pure Go, though it is called entirely via C bindings by the SDL audio callback, for the most idiomatic Go approach to solving the **sequence mixing** problem.

### Usage

Here's an example implementation of **go-sdl2** + **go-atomix**:

    package main
    
    import (
      "time"    
      "github.com/veandco/go-sdl2/sdl"
      "github.com/outrightmental/go-atomix"
    )
    
    func main() {
      if err := sdl.Init(sdl.INIT_AUDIO); err != nil {
        panic(err)
      }
      defer sdl.Quit()
    
      var (
        start = time.Now().Add(1 * time.Second) // 1 second delay before start
        beat = 500 * time.Millisecond
        loops = 4
        )
    
      var (
        p808 = "assets/sounds/percussion/808/"
        kick1 = p808 + "kick1.wav"
        kick2 = p808 + "kick2.wav"
        snare = p808 + "snare.wav"
        marac = p808 + "maracas.wav"
        )
        
      spec := atomix.Spec(&sdl.AudioSpec{
        Freq:     44100,
        Format:   sdl.AUDIO_U16,
        Channels: 2,
        Samples:  4096,
      })
    
      t := start
      loopDur := 16 * step
      totalDur := time.Duration(0)
      for n := 0; n < loops; n++ {
        atomix.Play(kick1, t,               4 *step,  1.0)
        atomix.Play(marac, t.Add(1 *step),  1 *step,  0.5)
        atomix.Play(snare, t.Add(4 *step),  4 *step,  0.8)
        atomix.Play(marac, t.Add(6 *step),  1 *step,  0.5)
        atomix.Play(kick2, t.Add(7 *step),  4 *step,  0.9)
        atomix.Play(marac, t.Add(10 *step), 1 *step,  0.5)
        atomix.Play(kick2, t.Add(10 *step), 4 *step,  0.9)
        atomix.Play(snare, t.Add(12 *step), 4 *step,  0.8)
        atomix.Play(marac, t.Add(14 *step), 1 *step,  0.5)
        t = t.Add(loopDur)
        totalDur += loopDur
      }
      runLength := totalDur + 2 * time.Second
        
      sdl.OpenAudio(spec, nil)
      sdl.PauseAudio(false)
    
      time.Sleep(runLength)
    }
